# Code-quiz

A javascript timed quiz.

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a timed quiz project using Javascript. The user has a set time limit of 2 minutes to answer all questions. The user also loses 10 seconds for each incorrect answer. The final score is based on the time left multiplied by the number of correct answers.

If the time runs out before the user completes all questions, the quiz ends and the final score is zero. After the quiz the users can save their initial and the highscores will be displayed. To clear the highscores the user can click on the clear button.
